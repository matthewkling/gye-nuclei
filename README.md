# Climatic nuclei

This repository contains data and code associated with the paper **McLaughlin, Kling, Jackson, Zavaleta, and Ackerly (2025) Sustaining species of the future: ‘climatic nuclei’ for climate change adaptation. Global Change Biology.**

This analysis reproduces the figure below, which illustrates potential future climatic nuclei in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

> Fig. 4. Maps of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with Yellowstone National Park outlined in black.  Panels a, c and e show 1980-2010 baseline temperatures; b, d and f show 2041-2070 future temperatures under a SSP585 scenario (representing the upper boundary of the range of scenarios described in the literature). Panels on the left show mean annual temperatures. Panel c shows potential climatic nuclei locations (pink) based on d) the future dominant climates in the park (defined as the median 50% (IQR)). Panels on the right show e) the current dominant climates in the park, and f) the future locations of those climates.
